</div>
<p>The transition from a labour surplus economy to a mature economy.</p>
<p>Preparation: derivation of the Lewis model. Before we turn to the main questions of the assignment, we first build up the Lewis model. We will derive the most important equations for reference later on. Start by writing down the seven formulas that form blueprint of the Lewis design:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y_S=A_S L_S\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[w_S=A_S\\\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
Y_M=A_M K^\alpha L_M ^{1-\alpha}\\
w_M=[1-\alpha]\frac{Y_M}{L_M}\\
L=L_M+L_S\\
w_M=\phi w_S\\
\dot{K}= s_\pi [Y_M-w_M L_M ]-\delta K\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>We presume the meaning of all variables are known by the reader. In short, there are two sectors, a subsistence sector (subscript s) and a mature sector (subscript m). Only the mature sector works with capital, which is accumulated by saving a part of ‘profits’ (perhaps profits is somewhat a misnomer, total income of capitalists is meant). Over time, labour moves from the subsistence sector to the mature sector as a response to the wage gap determined by <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>.</p>
<p>Static Equilibria.</p>
<p>First consider the labour market. Start with equation [3] and rewrite as follows to find an expression for <span class="math inline">\(L_M\)</span> that only depends on K:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
w_M=(1-\alpha)\frac{Y_M }{L_M}\\
\rightarrow L_M=(1-\alpha)\frac{Y_M }{w_M}\nonumber \\
\rightarrow L_M=\frac{(1-\alpha) A_M K^\alpha (L_M)^{1-\alpha} }{w_M}   \nonumber \\
\rightarrow L_M=\frac{(1-\alpha) A_M K^\alpha (L_M)^{1-\alpha} }{\phi w_S} \nonumber \\
\rightarrow L_M=\frac{(1-\alpha) A_M K^\alpha (L_M)^{1-\alpha} }{\phi A_S} \nonumber \\
\rightarrow L_M=K[\frac{(1-\alpha) A_M }{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1}{\alpha}} \nonumber\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Then by equation [5]:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L_S=L-L_M       \rightarrow     L_S=L-K[\frac{(1-\alpha) A_M }{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}\]</span></p>
<p>Both [8] and [9] are only valid if <span class="math inline">\(L_M&lt;L\)</span>. This is equivalent to: <span class="math display">\[K[\frac{(1-\alpha) A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}&lt;L \\
\rightarrow K&lt;L[\frac{\phi A_S}{(1-\alpha) A_M}]^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}\equiv K^{\#}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(K^{\#}\)</span> is the amount of capital at the point where the economy reaches maturity: no longer any labour is employed in the subsistence sector. Next, turn to output. Using the labour market equilibria, we can rewrite equation [1] and [3]: <span class="math display">\[Y_S=A_S L_S=A_S L-A_S K[\frac{(1-\alpha) A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1}{\alpha}} \\\]</span> <span class="math display">\[Y_M=A_M K^\alpha [L_M]^{1-\alpha}=A_M K^\alpha [K[\frac{(1-\alpha) A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}]^{1-\alpha} \nonumber\\\]</span> <span class="math display">\[=K A_M [\frac{(1-\alpha) A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}\]</span></p>
<p>Since we work with a Cobb-Douglas production function in the mature sector, profits simply equal a fraction <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(Y_M\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y_M-w_M L_M= \alpha Y_M=\alpha K A_M [\frac{(1-\alpha) A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}\]</span></p>
<p>Finally, total output Y is defined as the sum of output in both sectors: <span class="math display">\[Y=Y_S+Y_M   =A_S L-K A_S [\frac{(1-\alpha) A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}+K A_M [\frac{(1-\alpha) A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}} \nonumber\]</span> <span class="math display">\[=A_S L-KA_S (\frac{(1-\alpha) A_M}{\phi A_S })^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}+K A_S\frac{\phi}{1-\alpha}[\frac{(1- \alpha) A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1}{\alpha}} \nonumber\]</span> <span class="math display">\[=A_S L+K A_S (\frac{(\frac{\phi}{(1-\alpha)}- 1)(1-\alpha)A_M}{\phi A_S})^{1-{\alpha}}\]</span></p>
<p>Dynamics.</p>
<p>Above we have found formulations for labour supply (per sector), output, profits and wages as a function of K and a bundle of exogenous variables. Since equation [7] specifies how K moves over time, we can analyse the dynamics the mentioned factors. First substitute profits as given by [13] into the capital accumulation equation and rewrite in terms of growth rates. <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\dot{K}= s_\pi [Y_M-w_M L_M ]-\delta K= \alpha s_\pi K A_M [\frac{(1-\alpha)A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}-\delta K \nonumber \\
\rightarrow \hat{K}=\alpha s_\pi A_M [\frac{(1-\alpha)A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}-\delta\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Note how the growth rate of capital is completely determined by exogenous variables (i.e. it is just a constant). Labour supply in the mature sector grows at the same rate as capital (as long as <span class="math inline">\(L_M&lt;L\)</span>): <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\dot{L_M}=\dot{K}[((1-\alpha)A_M/\phi A_S)]^(1/\alpha) \nonumber \\
\rightarrow \hat{L_M}=\frac{\dot{K}\frac{(1-\alpha)A_M}{\phi A_S}^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}}{K[\frac{(1-\alpha)A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}}=\hat{K}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Subsistence sector income should shrink over time, feeding the growing mature sector with labour: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\dot{Y_S}=-\dot{K}A_S [\frac{(1-\alpha)A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1}{\alpha}} \nonumber \\
\rightarrow \hat{Y_S}=-\dot{K}A_S \frac{[\frac{(1-\alpha)A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}}{A_S L-A_S K(\frac{(1-\alpha)A_M}{\phi A_S})^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}} \nonumber \\
=-\hat{K}A_S \frac{[\frac{(1-\alpha)A_M}{\phi A_S}]{\frac{1}{\alpha}}}{\frac{A_S L}{K}-A_S [\frac{(1-\alpha)A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}} \\
\dot{Y_M}=\dot{K}A_M [\frac{(1-\alpha)A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}} \nonumber \\
\rightarrow \hat{Y_M}=\frac{\dot{K}A_M [\frac{(1-\alpha)A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}}{KA_M [\frac{(1-\alpha)A_M}{\phi A_S}]^{\frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}}} \nonumber \\
=\hat{K}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Because both inputs in the mature sector grow at rate <span class="math inline">\(\hat{K}\)</span>, income in the mature sector does as well. Moreover, since profits are just a fraction of mature income, it shares the same growth rate <span class="math inline">\(\hat{K}\)</span>. We conclude this section by deriving total income growth. <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\dot{Y}=\dot{K} A_S (\frac{\phi}{1-\alpha}-1)\frac{(1-\alpha) A_M}{\phi A_S}^{\frac{1}{\alpha}} \nonumber \\
\rightarrow \hat{Y} =\frac{\dot{K} A_S (\frac{\phi}{1-\alpha}-1)\frac{(1-\alpha)A_M}{\phi A_S}^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}}{Y} \nonumber \\
\rightarrow \hat{Y} =\dot{K} A_S \frac{(\frac{\phi}{1-\alpha}-1)(\frac{1-\alpha}{\phi} \frac{A_M}{A_S} )^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}}{A_S L+K A_S (\frac{\phi}{1-\alpha}-1)(\frac{1-\alpha}{\phi} \frac{A_M}{A_S} )^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}} \nonumber \\
\rightarrow \hat{Y} =\hat{K} A_S \frac{(\frac{\phi}{1-\alpha}-1)(\frac{(1-\alpha)}{\phi}  \frac{A_M}{A_S} )^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}}{\frac{A_S L}{K}+A_S (\frac{\phi}{1-\alpha}-1)(\frac{(1-\alpha)}{\phi}  \frac{A_M}{A_S})^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}} \nonumber \\
\rightarrow \hat{Y} =\hat{K} A_S \frac{(\frac{\phi}{1-\alpha}-1)(\frac{1-\alpha}{\phi}  \frac{A_M}{A_S}) ^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}+\frac{A_S L}{K}-\frac{A_S L}{K}}{\frac{A_S L}{K}+A_S (\frac{\phi}{1-\alpha}-1)(\frac{1-\alpha}{\phi}  \frac{A_M}{A_S})^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}} \nonumber \\
\rightarrow \hat{Y} =\hat{K} (1-\frac{A_S L}{A_S L+K A_S (\frac{\phi}{1-\alpha}-1)(\frac{1-\alpha}{\phi}  \frac{A_M}{A_S})^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}} \nonumber \\
= \hat{K} [1- A_S \frac{L}{Y}]\end{aligned}\]</span> Over time <span class="math inline">\(A_S\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(L/Y\)</span> becomes smaller, leading to an increasing growth rate of income.</p>
<p>A. Savings rate assumptions The Lewis model assumes that a fixed fraction of profits is reinvested; the Solow model assumes that a fixed fraction of total income is reinvested. Let’s compare the two assumptions: How does the Lewis model change if the Solow assumption about savings rates is used and vice versa? Show the dynamics of the models.</p>
<p>When connecting the Solow model and the Lewis model, the main issue is the different approach both models take with respect to the saving rate. In order to illustrate this, we use the following notation:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> the savings rate as a fraction of total income (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(Y_M\)</span> + <span class="math inline">\(Y_S\)</span> in case of the Lewis model). <span class="math inline">\(s_Ym\)</span> the savings rate as a fraction of income in the mature sector (only relevant for Lewis). <span class="math inline">\(s_\pi\)</span> the savings rate as a fraction of profits.</p>
<p>Superscript L and S are used when referring to the Lewis model and the Solow model, respectively. If we reformulate the general assumptions of both paradigms in these terms, the Solow model usually specifies <span class="math inline">\(s^S\)</span>, whereas the Lewis model normally works with <span class="math inline">\({s_\pi}^L\)</span>. Now suppose, perhaps naively, that we equalize these saving rates, such that <span class="math inline">\(s^S={s_\pi}^L\)</span>. To make these saving rates more easily comparable, we first rewrite <span class="math inline">\({s_\pi}^L\)</span> in terms of a saving rate as a percentage of total income <span class="math inline">\(s^L\)</span>. Note that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[s_\pi^L [Y_M-w_M L_M ]= \alpha s_\pi^L Y_M= \alpha s_\pi^L  \frac{Y_M}{Y} Y=s^L Y   \rightarrow s^L=\alpha s_\pi^L  \frac{Y_M}{Y}\]</span></p>
<p>At the maturity point of the economy, where <span class="math inline">\(K=K^{\#}\)</span>, it holds that <span class="math inline">\(Y_M=Y\)</span> by definition. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(s^L={\alpha s_\pi}^L\)</span> at the transition point between Lewis and Solow. Yet for <span class="math inline">\(K&gt;K^{\#}\)</span>, note that <span class="math inline">\(s^S&gt;{\alpha s_\pi}^L\)</span>, which implies that the graph of the saving rate as a function of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> makes a sudden hike at <span class="math inline">\(K^{\#}\)</span>. Visually:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="graph1.png" alt="[fig:Graph 1]saving rate as a function of K." />
<p class="caption">[fig:Graph 1]saving rate as a function of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The saving rate is a smooth function over the Lewis range, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(K&lt;K^{\#}\)</span>, (it rises because the mature sector becomes an increasingly large part of the economy), but is discontinuous at the point where the Solow range is entered. There is no economic reason for this sudden hike and hence it is a problem we need to resolve if we want to link both models. Several possibilities are available.</p>
<p>I. Adjust the Solow model: save a fraction of “profits”. In the Solow model, one could define savings on the basis of profits instead of total income: set <span class="math inline">\(s_\pi^s=s_\pi^L\)</span>. We know that the total income of capitalists equals a fraction <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> of total income (as a result of the Cobb-Douglas production function). Hence, this adjustment comes down to setting <span class="math inline">\(s^s= \alpha s_\pi^s\)</span>, a factor <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> lower than before. The gap in the savings function at <span class="math inline">\(K^{\#}\)</span> in graph 1 will disappears (see graph 2).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="graph2.png" alt="[fig:Graph 2]In the Solow range, define savings on the basis of profits: s shifts downward to the red line." />
<p class="caption">[fig:Graph 2]In the Solow range, define savings on the basis of profits: <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> shifts downward to the red line.</p>
</div>
<p>Obviously, the dynamics over the Lewis range remain unaltered, since no variable has changed in that dimension. With respect to the Solow range, the smaller saving fraction means that the rate of capital accumulation decreases… <span class="math display">\[\hat{K}= \alpha s^s k^{\alpha-1}-\delta&lt;s^s k^{\alpha-1}-\delta\]</span></p>
<p>…as well as lowering the steady-state income level:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y^{\star} = \frac{\alpha s^s}{\delta}^{\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}}&lt;\frac{s^s}{\delta}^{\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}}\]</span></p>
<p>II. Adjust the Lewis model: save a fraction of total income in the maturity sector. The reversed case is to use mature sector income <span class="math inline">\(Y_M\)</span> as the basis for savings in the Lewis model, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(s_{Ym}= s^s\)</span>, mirroring the total income savings rate of the Solow model. Again, given the Cobb-Douglas production function, profits equal a fraction <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> of mature income. Thus, this modification is similar to selecting <span class="math inline">\(s_\pi^L=\frac{s_{Ym}}{\alpha}\)</span>, inflating <span class="math inline">\(s_\pi^L\)</span> by a factor <span class="math inline">\(1/\alpha\)</span> compared to before. Graphically, the part of the savings curve before maturity is shifted upwards and the discontinuity has disappeared (see graph 3). From equation [15] it is clearly visible that the rate of capital growth increases by taking a broader basis for our savings. As a consequence, total income <span class="math inline">\(Y_M+Y_S\)</span> grows faster as well, see equation [19]. This change in dynamics over the Lewis range is displayed in graph 4.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="graph3.png" alt="[fig:Graph 3]In the Lewis range, define savings on the basis of mature income: s shifts upward to the red line." />
<p class="caption">[fig:Graph 3]In the Lewis range, define savings on the basis of mature income: <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> shifts upward to the red line.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img src="graph4.png" alt="[fig:Graph 4]Comparison of growth rates of Y and K (in the Lewis range): a savings rate based on profits (sub-script 0, green) versus a saving rate based on mature income (subscript 1, red)." />
<p class="caption">[fig:Graph 4]Comparison of growth rates of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> (in the Lewis range): a savings rate based on profits (sub-script 0, green) versus a saving rate based on mature income (subscript 1, red).</p>
</div>
<p>III. Adjust the Lewis model: save a fraction of total income (in both sectors). Instead of focussing solely on income in the mature sector, one could involve the subsistence sector as well: use <span class="math inline">\(Y_M+Y_S\)</span> as the basis for the saving rate in the Lewis model. This amounts to setting <span class="math inline">\(s^L= s^s\)</span>. As a percentage of total income, the savings rate in the Lewis range is now no longer increasing with <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, instead it will be a constant function. Naturally this eliminates any discontinuity issues (see also graph 5).</p>
<p>This adjustment has much larger consequences compared to the previous two cases: we have to reformulate the complete dynamics of the model, instead of simply changing one parameter. The capital accumulation equation now becomes: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\dot{K}= s^L Y-\delta K= s^L A_S L+s^L K A_S (\frac{\phi}{1-\alpha}- 1)(\frac{(1-\alpha)A_M}{\phi A_S})^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}-\delta K \nonumber \\
\rightarrow \hat{K} =s^L A_S \frac{L}{K}+s^L A_S (\frac{\phi}{1-\alpha}- 1)(\frac{(1-\alpha)A_M}{\phi A_S})^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}-\delta \end{aligned}\]</span> Hence capital does no longer grow at a constant rate. Graph 6 shows what happens to the growth rate of capital and total income if we save a fixed fraction of total income.</p>
